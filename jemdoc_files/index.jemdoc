I am a M.S. student in the [https://cse.umn.edu/cs Department of Computer Science & Engineering] at the 
[https://twin-cities.umn.edu/ University of Minnesota, Twin Cities], also
work as a graduate research assistant in [https://sunju.org/ Prof. Ju Sun]'s group.

Broadly, my research is about *optimization in machine\/deep learning* and *machine\/deep learning in vision*.

Specifically, I am interested in:
    . User-friendly and scalable software for nonconvex optimization in machine/deep learning. 
    . Deep Learning with deterministic and stochastic constraints.
    . Learning in distributed and collaborative environments.

Prior to this, I obtained my first M.S. degree in [https://cse.umn.edu/cems Materials Science] at the 
[https://twin-cities.umn.edu/ University of Minnesota, Twin Cities], and my B.S. degree from the 
[https://physics.nju.edu.cn/ School of Physics], [https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp Nanjing University]. 

Before joining [https://sunju.org/ Prof. Ju Sun]'s group, I worked as a research assistant in [http://siepmann.chem.umn.edu/ Prof. J. Ilja Siepmann]'s
 computational chemistry group.

== Updates

\[Feb 20, 2022\] [https://github.com/sun-umn/PyGRANSO *PyGRANSO*] v1.1.0 released. Join our [https://groups.google.com/g/ncvx NCVX PyGRANSO Forum] for more information!

\[Feb 12, 2022\] Completed my third Powerlifting meet! Check [https://buyunliang.org/powerlifting.html this page] for more details. See [https://www.instagram.com/buyun_liang/ my instagram] for my daily training videos.

\[Jan 07, 2022\] Our NCVX package is highlighted in [https://rc.umn.edu/project/building-numerical-optimization-software Research Computing (Office of the Vice President for Research)] 

\[Jan 01, 2022\] [https://github.com/sun-umn/NCVX NCVX] with its initial solver *PyGRANSO* v1.0.0 released. Check the [https://ncvx.org/ documentation page] and [https://github.com/sun-umn/NCVX GitHub repo] for more information.

\[Nov 29, 2021\] Proud to release our paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13984 NCVX: A User-Friendly and Scalable Package for Nonconvex Optimization in Machine Learning] on arXiv! [https://ncvx.org/ NCVX] is the initial translation and revamping of the [http://www.timmitchell.com/software/GRANSO/ GRANSO package], with convenient features such as auto-differentiation and GPU support. In particular, NCVX can be used to solve constrained deep learning problems.

\[May 25, 2021\] I am funded by the [https://research.umn.edu/units/umii U of M Informatics Institute (UMII) Seed Grant Program] 
to revamp the [http://www.timmitchell.com/software/GRANSO/ GRANSO] package into a user-friendly, scalable numerical optimization package.
